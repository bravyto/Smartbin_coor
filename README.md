## Before You Start
There are some terms you should understand before starting this tutorial.

1. **Open chat**: Open chat is a public chat. There is a channel which can be participated by anyone without an admission. The channel can be created on `SendBird` dashboard or via `server API`.

2. **1-on-1 messaging**: 1-on-1 messaging is a private channel between two users. Basically it is same as group messaging channel with only two members.

3. **Group messaging**: Group messaging is a private channel between multiple users. The user who wants to join the Group messaging channel has to be invited by other user who is already joined the Group messaging channel.


## See SendBird in Action
Build and run the Quick Start project to start an open chat or a 1:1 messaging. 

- The sample project is shipped with test ** `SendBird App ID` **.
- ** You must replace with your own `App ID` found in `SendBird Dashboard` for production use. **
